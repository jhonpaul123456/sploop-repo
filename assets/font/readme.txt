NINJASCRIPTA true type font familyby P.D. Magnuswww.fontmonkey.comThe basic font has caps, full-keyboard, euro symbol, &c.The bold styles have alphanumeric with only some of the  punctuation.The small caps font has a complete repertoire of accents,  umlauts, &c.The untercase font has upper and lowercase and full  international whatnots. The italics for the untercase font  have silly handdrawn serifs that are the kind of thing I  tend to do when lettering mild emphasis.I crafted this font for use in drawing Ninja Verses cartoons.Like old school comic book lettering, the basic font is capsonly, with a few characters slightly streamlined in the lowercase.The fonts might be good for any sort of comic work. For me,they have the advantages of belonging to me and looking like myactual hand-writing.For you, they have the advantage of beingthe font you just downloaded.
